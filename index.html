    title: "How does it work?"
    excerpt: "MobiVM translates Java bytecode into LLVM IR as an intermediate representation, which is later compiled into native code for the targeted platform. This approach allows you to use any widely available codebase from the Java ecosystem at native platform speed. As MobiVM builds upon the Java platform, any JVM language can be used, for example Java, Kotlin or DukeScript. The built-in tree shaker effectively drops classes which are not used within the code path and allows us to keep the binary footprint at a minimum."
